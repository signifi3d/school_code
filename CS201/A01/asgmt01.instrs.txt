CS201 ASSIGNMENT 1 INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------

Remember that you only need to do one of these, either the Regular or the
Premium version.

For either version, do not use the pow() function defined in math.h.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REGULAR VERSION

First, your program should print out either "byte order: big-endian" or
"byte order: little-endian" depending on the characteristics of the machine
your code is running on. Your program should figure this out at run time,
not at compile time.

Then, using scanf() and printf(), write a program that requests numbers from the
user (typed in decimal) and then prints each number out in a variety of formats.

For each number typed in, your program should print out two lines:

    first line:
        * integer, right justified in a 10 character field
        * hex representation of the integer (the 4-byte actual value that is
            independent of the machine's endian-ness)
    second line:
        * floating, right justified in a 10 character field, with 2 digits to
            the right of the decimal point
        * hex representation of the floating number (the 4-byte actual value
            that is independent of the machine's endian-ness). Do not use C99's
            %a or %A format specifier for this. You are required to use the %X
            (NOT the %x) format specifier.

Your program should repeatedly ask for input until the user types in a zero, and
then it should exit. Each number in the input will be an integer, expressed as a
decimal number. Some of the numbers will be negative, expressed like this: -3.
You do not need to worry about bad input. I will run your code with a script
that does not do this.

Your program's output should be formatted as shown in asgmt01.output.txt
(including uppercase vs. lowercase). I use scripts to grade assignments, and if
your output is formatted "creatively" (i.e. different from what's requested),
you will lose points for that.

Start with file a01.c.

Upload your work as a01.c.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREMIUM VERSION

First, your program should print out either "byte order: big-endian" or "byte
order: little-endian" depending on the characteristics of the machine your code
is running on. Your program should figure this out at run time, not at compile
time.

Then your code should accept user input in the form of 8 hexadecimal digits.
Your code will interpret those 8 digits as an IEEE 754 32-bit floating point
number and will print out information about that number. Do not worry about bad
input. My test script does not do this.

Use scanf to get the user input. Your code should accept input with or without
"0x" in front of it (scanf does this).

For each number, your code should print out:

    * the sign bit
    * the exponent bits, expressed as a decimal number
    * the fraction bits, expressed as an 8 digit hexadecimal number

Here is what your code should print out for the various types of floating point
number:

    * normalized
        the word "normalized" and the true exponent
        (i.e. the power to which 2 will be raised in computing the numerical
        value of the floating point number)
    * denormalized
        the word "denormalized" and the true exponent
    * infinity
        "+infinity" or "-infinity"
    * zero
        "+zero" or "-zero"
    * NaN
        "SNaN" or "QNan"

Your program's output should be formatted exactly as shown in asgmt01p.output.txt
(including uppercase vs. lowercase). Use %X for formatting hex output, NOT %x.
I use scripts to grade assignments, and if your output is formatted "creatively"
(i.e. different from what's requested), you will lose points for that.

Your program should exit when user input that results in a zero value is
entered, after printing the information for that zero input.

Start with file a01p.c, contained in the provided zip file.

Upload your work as a01p.c.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REQUIRED PLATFORM

I grade your code on syccuxas01.pcc.edu. Your code is required to compile and
run correctly on that machine.

COMPILING YOUR CODE

You are required to compile your code with the same flags that are used by
the 'gc' bash script in ~michael.trigoboff/bin.

GRADING YOUR CODE

Your code needs to compile without errors or warnings and run correctly. Code
that does not compile will receive zero points. Code that crashes will receive
zero points.

I use bash scripts to grade your code. Because of this, it is very important
that you submit your code with the file name that was requested. If you change
the file name, my scripts will crash, your work will not be graded, you will
have to resubmit a corrected version of your work, and you will lose points.

My scripts produce a log file containing your code, compiler warnings and errors
(if any), your code's output, and some statistics that are useful to me. I then
personally go through that log file to produce your grade. In other words, the
scripts don't generate your grade, they just make it more convenient for me to
generate your grade.

TO SUBMIT THIS ASSIGNMENT

Submit the requested file to Desire2Learn.

    * Be certain to check that you completed the upload successfully. After you
        click the Upload File button, you must also click the SUBMIT ASSIGNMENT
        button. This is very easy to forget. If you do not do this, I will not
        see your work and you will get a grade of zero for the assignment. I
        would recommend entering an email address so you can be notified that
        the upload was completed successfully.
    * You may upload as many versions as you wish prior to the due date. I will
        only see and grade the final one. You will not be able to upload
        assignments after the due date.

Points will be deducted for uploading a file with a name that is not as
specified. Every term I get a few students whose approach to following
directions is, shall we say, "creative." I encourage creativity in general, but
there are places where it is not appropriate.
