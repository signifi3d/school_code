Mostly just some OpenSSL library boilerplate code I grabbed from [here](https://opensource.com/article/19/6/cryptography-basics-openssl-part-1), so thanks to them for that. It sends a POST request I pulled from Burp, except it doesn't send the body of the request all at once. It sends one character of the body every 2 seconds, which trips up the server's WAF that checks for valid ticket costs.
